# DAVE3625-Assignment-2

For this assigment we will predict TESLA stock prices.

We chose a regression algorithm because we want to output stock prices for a given date, which is a numerical value. A classification algorithm is better suited for binary output (perhaps for predicing if a stock will go either up or down).

We chose a Decision Tree Regression algorithm because the tree structure fits well with the way stock prices move (up or down).

Our Decision Tree Regression model scored around 98%.
